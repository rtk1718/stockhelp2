<br><b>Dividend-</b>&nbsp;Dividends are usually declared by a company's board of directors and are paid on a per-share basis. They represent a way for companies to share their profits with their shareholders. Dividend payments can be made on a regular basis, such as quarterly or annually, or they can be irregular or one-time payments.

  Investors often view dividends as a way to generate income from their stock investments. However, not all companies pay dividends. Some companies, especially younger or high-growth companies, may choose to reinvest their earnings back into the business instead of distributing them as dividends.
  <br>
  <br><b>Market cap-</b>&nbsp;The market capitalization, or market cap, of a stock is a measure of the total value of a publicly traded company. It is calculated by multiplying the company's current share price by the total number of outstanding shares.
<br>
  <br><b>ROE-</b>&nbsp;ROE stands for Return on Equity. It is a financial ratio that measures the profitability and efficiency of a company in generating returns for its shareholders' equity. ROE is expressed as a percentage and is calculated by dividing net income by average shareholders' equity.

  <br>
    &nbsp;The formula for calculating ROE is as follows:
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;ROE = (Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity) x 100
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;Net income is the company's total earnings after deducting expenses, taxes, and interest. Shareholders' equity represents the residual interest in the company's assets after deducting liabilities and is calculated as the difference between total assets and total liabilities.
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;ROE is an important metric used by investors and analysts to assess a company's profitability and its ability to generate returns on the capital invested by shareholders. A higher ROE indicates better profitability and efficiency, as it means the company is generating more profit for each dollar of shareholders' equity.
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp; However, it's important to compare ROE within the same industry or sector, as different industries can have different average ROE levels. Additionally, it's crucial to analyze ROE in conjunction with other financial ratios and factors to get a comprehensive understanding of a company's financial health and performance.
    <br>
  
    <br>
    <br><b>Debt to equity -</b>&nbsp;Debt to Equity (D/E) is a financial ratio that indicates the proportion of a company's total debt to its shareholders' equity. It provides insight into the company's financial leverage and capital structure. The D/E ratio is calculated by dividing the company's total debt by its shareholders' equity.
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;The D/E ratio serves as an indicator of the company's financial risk and solvency. A higher D/E ratio implies that the company relies more on debt financing, which can increase financial risk and interest expenses. On the other hand, a lower D/E ratio indicates a more conservative capital structure and less reliance on debt.
